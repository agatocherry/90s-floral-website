        <p class="facts">The cherry blossom (sakura 桜 in Japanese), the flower of the cherry tree, is most famous in Japan, where the Hanami festival takes place.<br>"Hanami" literally translates to "looking at flowers," and this is when people gather for picnics under the blooming cherry trees.<br>These flowers bloom briefly, typically from March to April. In art, they symbolize both beauty and death due to their short-lived bloom. <br>Hokusai, a famous Japanese artist, often depicted these flowers in his works. 🌸
