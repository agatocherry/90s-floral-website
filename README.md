# 90s-Floral-Website 🌸/🌹  
My project for the Codédex Hackathon (December 2024): a cute and nostalgic 90s-style floral website featuring an herbarium with cherry blossoms and other flowers. This is also my first website! 🌸✨

## About the project 💻  
![Preview](assets/images/preview.gif)
This website is designed for **1080x1920** screen resolution. You can view the live site [here](https://90s-floral-website.vercel.app/).  
I used Vercel to host the website and also integrated its analytics features.
